Google servers are quite shy in answering api calls from strangers. So they have an upper bound on how many api calls you can make on their servers to shorten your long urls. Thus they recommend developers to <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/console">register and use api keys</a>. GoShortener gem didn't provide facility to include api keys before. <br /><br />Now starting with <a href="https://github.com/luckydev/goshortener/tree/v1.2">v1.2</a>, GoShortener can be used with/without google api keys. <br /><br />Here is an example usage sessions in irb.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/837501.js"> </script>
