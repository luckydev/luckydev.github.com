This is applicable only if you have installed NewRelic as a gem inside your project. I am using Rails3 for my app development and adding the below lines in my deploy file worked for me.<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/755962.js?file=deploy.rb"></script><br /><br />For other details, you can read this <a href="http://support.newrelic.com/kb/docs/recording-deployments-with-the-ruby-agent">article</a>
