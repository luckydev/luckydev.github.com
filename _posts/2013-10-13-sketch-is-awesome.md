 If you are in any way associated with building software, you must get sketch app and play around. Designing software components in it is super fast. 
Here is why I think it is better than Photoshop.
1. 100% vector. I can zoom 300% into a component and design it to the very detail i want. 
2. Exporting/Slicing is freaking fast and easy.
3. The whole software is less than 20MB.
