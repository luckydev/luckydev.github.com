I moved from Android to iOS. I wouldnâ€™t have said this better than [him](https://marco.org/).

Developers choose to build for a platform if

1. They use it.
2. A lot of others use it.
3. They can make a living out of it.

Google Nexus was my first smartphone. The reason why I stopped using Android and went to iOS is because Android was incomplete. And iOS simply nails all of the above.

Happy ever since I made the move!
