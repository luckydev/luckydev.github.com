Eddy Cue is taking over the online services end of Apple. I feel it’s the best decision Apple has ever taken. This should have happened long back, even before Forstall’s exit.

Even though I hate Android, the breadth of online services tied to such phones is really good. Google search, Gmail, Youtube, Google Docs, Maps, Google Drive, Google+ and of course Google Play. Apple has the best hardware you can find in a mobile device but they have to catch up quickly in order to match Google’s online services offering.

I’d say - even if they don’t release any new hardware next year and focus purely on strengthening their cloud services.. Nothing like it.

And the decision of putting all online services into one group under Eddy cue is just so right.
