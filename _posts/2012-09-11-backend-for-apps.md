Let’s say you are into building iOS Apps. 

If your app is made for single user and if it needs backend just for data sync between devices - Use iCloud.

If you want a good backend to work with multiple users data, but if you don’t know how to build one - Use Parse.

If you know how to build a backend (say in Ruby on Rails), but don’t want to do server admin activities - Use Heroku.

If you know how to build your backend, want to have complete freedom and love to do server admin tasks - Use AWS.
