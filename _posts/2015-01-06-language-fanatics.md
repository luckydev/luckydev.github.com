I hate language fanatics. People call themselves as Rubyists or Pythonistas or JavaScriptists (or whatever). It’s too bad to brand yourself like this and too bad to let anyone else brand you that way.

Of course you can be passionate about something and focus on one thing for a period of time. That’s how you get good at it.

But you must also be open to learn good parts from the other world. And incorporate into your own. And you must be ready to move on with all the lessons you learnt in the current language and learn something new if it does things differently and solves a problem in a better way.

It helps in solving problems. It helps in getting the overall picture. Otherwise I see no point of being in programming. There is always a reset button in our world once in every two-three years.
