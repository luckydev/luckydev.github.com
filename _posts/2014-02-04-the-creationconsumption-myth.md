Lots of people think that Content creation happens on the desktop and Consumption happens on the devices like iPhone and iPad. These are short sighted opinions. 

You touch and move, the object moves under your finger. Devices enabling such direct interactions are the ideal platforms for creation. We just don’t have enough tools in the app store to expose all the power to users.

In fact, the devices can open up completely new class of software and usage patterns. Only a few apps stand out really well. Like - [StoreHouse](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/17/6266453/storehouse-brings-its-beautiful-storytelling-app-to-iphone) and Fifty three’s [Paper](https://www.fiftythree.com/).
